ChatGPT – a generative pre-trained transformer – was fine-tuned on top of GPT-3.5 using supervised learning as well as reinforcement learning. 
Both approaches used human trainers to improve the model's performance. 
In the case of supervised learning, the model was provided with conversations in which the trainers played both sides: 
the user and the AI assistant. In the reinforcement step, human trainers first ranked responses that the model had created in a previous conversation. 
These rankings were used to create 'reward models' that the model was further fine-tuned on using several iterations of Proximal Policy Optimization (PPO).
Proximal Policy Optimization algorithms present a cost-effective benefit to trust region policy optimization algorithms; 
they negate many of the computationally expensive operations with faster performance.The models were trained in 
collaboration with Microsoft on their Azure supercomputing infrastructure.

In addition, OpenAI continues to gather data from ChatGPT users that could be used to further train and fine-tune ChatGPT. 
Users are allowed to upvote or downvote the responses they receive from ChatGPT; upon upvoting or downvoting, 
they can also fill out a text field with additional feedback.
